# Hazard Proximity Tool

## About

The hazard proximity tool (name TBD) uses geospatial data to calculate the average population-level proximity to an environmental hazard or hazards. This tool may be used to support exploratory analysis of different health outcomes. This tool is based on the Superfund Proximity measurement described in the Environmental Protection Agency [EJScreen Tool Technical Documentation](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-07/ejscreen-tech-doc-version-2-3.pdf).
